Make sure to replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.

To use this code, follow these steps:

Install the OpenAI Python library if you haven't already:

Copy code
pip install openai
Copy the above code into a file, for example, chatgpt_terminal.py.

Replace 'YOUR_API_KEY' with your actual OpenAI API key.

Run the Python script in the terminal:

Copy code
python chatgpt_terminal.py
Now you can start interacting with ChatGPT in the Linux terminal. Type your input after the > prompt, and ChatGPT will provide a response based on the input. To exit the script, simply type "exit".
